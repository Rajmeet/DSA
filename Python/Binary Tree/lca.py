# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
# Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
# Output: 3
